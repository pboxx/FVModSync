#FVModSync

A tool to install game mods for [Life is Feudal: Forest Village]. FVModSync enables users to organise their mods in a separate folder and copy them over automatically, rather than having to edit files in the game folder by hand. This ought to make it easier for players to use various different mods in parallel, at least until an official tool for this purpose is released. Also, it allows modders to include only the relevant data (i.e. content they have actually changed) in their mods, which enhances compatibility between different mods.

##Releases

This is currently in beta. See [Releases] for releases and notes, and the [develop branch] for ongoing development.

##Troubleshooting / Feedback

You can post here in [Issues] or in the [Feedback thread], Forest Village modding group on Steam.
